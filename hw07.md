## (1)
int_8 a=1;

int_8 c=a+3;

过程是这样的：LOD #1→STO X→LOD X→ADD#3→STO Y→HLT

## (2)循环
主存储器→获取指令→对指令进行解码→放在寄存器里→获得数据→执行指令→返回到主存储器

## (3)
IR:指的是寄存器(Registers),用于寄存当前正在执行的指令。

PC:计数器,存放下一条指令在内存中的地址

ACC：累加寄存器,为ALU提供工作区并用于暂存运算结果。

## (4)
>计算机语言中的var在Pascal 作为程序的保留字，用于定义变量.

那么vars a&c的含义应该就是定义两个变量一个叫a一个叫c用于程序中的保留字！！

# 2.
(1)指令和数据

(2)可以的

(3)ADD X :00000000 10000000

## (1)汇编语言

汇编语言（英语：assembly language）是一种用于电子计算机、微处理器、微控制器，或其他可编程器件的低级语言。在不同的设备中，汇编语言对应着不同的机器语言指令集。一种汇编语言专用于某种计算机系统结构，而不像许多高级语言，可以在不同系统平台之间移植。

## (2)编译
A compiler is computer software that primarily translates computer code from a high-level programming language to machine code to create an executable program. A compiler can also be used to convert computer code written in one programming language into another programming language. Technically compilers are a type of translator that support digital devices, primarily computers.

## (3)命令式语言
In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.

The term is often used in contrast to declarative programming, which focuses on what the program should accomplish without specifying how the program should achieve the result.

## (4)函数编程语言
In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements. In functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are passed to the function, so calling a function f twice with the same value for an argument x produces the same result f(x) each time; this is in contrast to procedures depending on a local or global state, which may produce different results at different times when called with the same arguments but a different program state. Eliminating side effects, i.e., changes in state that do not depend on the function inputs, can make it much easier to understand and predict the behavior of a program, which is one of the key motivations for the development of functional programming.

## (5)过程式编程
rocedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself. The first major procedural programming languages first appeared circa 1960, including Fortran, ALGOL, COBOL and BASIC.Pascal and C were published closer to the 1970s.
