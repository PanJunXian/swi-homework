# 第三次作业

## I、Write out variables x,y and z in binary code.
### 1) int8_t x = 67; int8_t y = -7; int8_t z=y-x;
   
   binary: x=1000011; y=-111; z=1001010;


### 2) int8_t x=0xd3;

   binary x = 11010011;(溢出)


### 3) uint8_t x=0xd3;

   binary x = 11010011;(溢出)


### 4) int8_t x = 127; int8_t y = -7; int8_t z =y - x;

   binary x =1111111;  y=-111; z= 10000110(溢出)；


### 5) float x = 1.125;
  
   binary x = 1.001 ; 

### 6) float x = 23.0;
 
   binary x = 10111;

### 7) float x = 0.45;

   binary x =0.01110011(精度误差)；


## II、使用维基百科解释以下概念

### Method of  complements
>In mathematics and computing, the method of complements is a technique used to subtract one number from another using only addition of positive numbers. This method was commonly used in mechanical calculators and is still used in modern computers.

>The nines' complement of a number is formed by replacing each digit with nine minus that digit. To subtract a decimal number y (the subtrahend) from another number x (the minuend) two methods may be used:

>In the first method the nines' complement of x is added to y. Then the nines' complement of the result obtained is formed to produce the desired result.

>In the second method the nines' complement of y is added to x and one is added to the sum. The leading digit '1' of the result is then discarded. Discarding the initial '1' is especially convenient on calculators or computers that use a fixed number of digits: there is nowhere for it to go so it is simply lost during the calculation. The nines' complement plus one is known as the ten's complement.

>The method of complements can be extended to other number bases (radices); in particular, it is used on most digital computers to perform subtraction, represent negative numbers in base 2 or binary arithmetic and test underflow and overflow in calculation.

### Byte
>The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits, representing a binary number. Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single character of text in a computer[1][2] and for this reason it is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many computer architectures.

>The size of the byte has historically been hardware dependent and no definitive standards existed that mandated the size – byte-sizes from 1[3] to 48 bits[4] are known to have been used in the past.[5][6] Early character encoding systems often used six bits, and machines using six-bit and nine-bit bytes were common into the 1960s. These machines most commonly had memory words of 12, 24, 36, 48 or 60 bits, corresponding to two, four, six, eight or 10 six-bit bytes. In this era, bytes in the instruction stream were often referred to as syllables, before the term byte became common.

>The modern de-facto standard of eight bits, as documented in ISO/IEC 2382-1:1993, is a convenient power of two permitting the values 0 through 255 for one byte.[7] The international standard IEC 80000-13 codified this common meaning. Many types of applications use information representable in eight or fewer bits and processor designers optimize for this common usage. The popularity of major commercial computing architectures has aided in the ubiquitous acceptance of the eight-bit size.[8] Modern architectures typically use 32- or 64-bit words, built of four or eight bytes.

>The unit symbol for the byte was designated as the upper-case letter B by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)[9] in contrast to the bit, whose IEEE symbol is a lower-case b. Internationally, the unit octet, symbol o, explicitly denotes a sequence of eight bits, eliminating the ambiguity of the byte.

### Integer (computer science)
>In computer science, an integer is a datum of integral data type, a data type that represents some range of mathematical integers. Integral data types may be of different sizes and may or may not be allowed to contain negative values. Integers are commonly represented in a computer as a group of binary digits (bits). The size of the grouping varies so the set of integer sizes available varies between different types of computers. Computer hardware, including virtual machines, nearly always provide a way to represent a processor register or memory address as an integer.

### Floating point
>In computing, floating-point arithmetic (FP) is arithmetic using formulaic representation of real numbers as an approximation so as to support a trade-off between range and precision. For this reason, floating-point computation is often found in systems which include very small and very large real numbers, which require fast processing times. A number is, in general, represented approximately to a fixed number of significant digits (the significand) and scaled using an exponent in some fixed base; the base for the scaling is normally two, ten, or sixteen.

## III、证明二进制的负数等于取反加一
>补码是在计算机内存中的存放的形式，第一个数字表示符号位，0正1负。
整数补码是其本身，负数补码是其绝对值的补码除了符号位以外的二进制数取反加1

## int8_t x = -017; 用8进制描述变量x、
 x=3*8^2+5*8+1

## NaN是什么？
Not a number;

## 阅读维基百科” Two‘s complement”的内容，特别是Sign extension小节内容。
1)C程序：int8_t x = -0x1f; int y = x; 请用16进制描述变量 x 和 y，并说明 int y = x 的计算过程。

 0x就是16进制嘛 x=-1f   y=-31;

2)请用数学证明，为什么可以这么计算

就是十六进制化成十进制
